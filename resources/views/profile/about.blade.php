            <p><h4>Posts \ Blog</h4></p>
            <p><h5>As you probably know, most popular social networks or microblogging services
                limit the maximum number of characters when posting. We suggest that you forget
                about these restrictions (for example, 280 characters are allowed on Twitter,
                and 2000 on Instagram) and we provide you with as many as 5,000 characters for
                your notes. After the publication of your circle long post, you can easily and
                conveniently share a short link that we will provide you with our friends in other
                social networks.</h5></p>
            <p><h4>Events</h4></p>
            <p><h5>Are you a musician, actor or Navalny and are you going to hold some kind of event?
                No problem, we will give you this opportunity! You can create a page with your events
                on your profile. Add a poster, description, links to meetings on social networks and
                attach possible places to purchase tickets for your traffic. Well, of course, share a
                short link with your friends.</h5></p>
            <p><h4>Playlists \ Video</h4></p>
            <p><h5>Most likely you are a musician if you are interested in these services. Here you
                can fully submit your release. Post a cover or video, attach a playlist with
                your new tracks from any service, add a full description, and share your links to download or buy music.</h5></p>
            <p><h4>All this is of course free and, moreover, we will add new functionality.</h4></p>
